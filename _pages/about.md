I work at [Medius](https://medius.si), Slovenian based company specialised for
custom software development as chief data scientist. I started my studies with
the electrical engineering program at the University of Ljubljana in 2002.
I enrolled into Master study course covering fields of Automation and
Intelligent systems. During my studies I was mainly interested in developing
automated artificial systems with the help of data mining related tasks. After
completing an MSc in 2009, I enrolled into a PhD program at the same
University. My main interest remained the same, strongly related with the field
of pattern recognition. I focused on speech related technologies, such as
emotional recognition from speech, emotional and cross-lingual parametric
speech synthesis. You can check work and publications on one of the well known
research profiles as
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tadej-Justin) or [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=enGoogle
Scholaruser=405SSpEAAAAJ). During my studies and research, I started and
co-funded a micro company for consulting and development web based applications
in Python, using solutions such as CMS Plone, and frameworks like
[Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) or
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). Because of my studies of
automation courses, I was always interested in the field of Continuous
Deployment and Continuous Integrations, in other words - in DevOps. 
Since the era of Kubernetes I have followed its progress and evaluation and at
the end of 2019 I successfully certified as [Kubernetes
Administrator](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/5a5265c2-a855-4524-8195-94a287da6725).
All the knowledge obtained from the DevOps field I constantly use in daily
work, helping me and my team deliver software enhanced with predictive
functionalities seamlessly to production.
