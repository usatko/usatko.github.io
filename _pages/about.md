I work at [Medius](https://medius.si), a Slovenian-based company specialised in
custom software development, as Chief Data Scientist. I obtained my bachelor’s
degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Ljubljana in 2009.
I enrolled into a master’s study course covering the fields of Automation and
Intelligent systems. During my studies I was mainly interested in developing
artificial intelligent systems based on machine learning and data mining. After
completing MSc, I enrolled into a PhD program at the same University.
My main research interest was strongly related to the field of pattern
recognition, more specifically, I focused on speech related technologies, such
as emotional recognition from speech, and emotional and cross-lingual
parametric speech synthesis. You can find my work and publications on
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tadej-Justin) or [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=enGoogle
Scholaruser=405SSpEAAAAJ). During my studies and research, I started and
co-founded a micro company for consulting and development of web-based
applications in Python, using solutions such as [Plone CMS](https://plone.org/)
and frameworks like [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) or
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). Thanks to my studies in
Automation, I retained my fascination with the field of Continuous Deployment
and Continuous Integrations, in other words, with DevOps. Since the start of
the era of Kubernetes, I have followed its progress and at the end of 2019
I successfully obtained my certification as [Kubernetes
Administrator](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/5a5265c2-a855-4524-8195-94a287da6725).
The knowledge obtained from the DevOps field I constantly use in daily work at
Medius, and it is helping me and my team deliver quality software enhanced with
predictive functionalities seamlessly from its conception to production.
